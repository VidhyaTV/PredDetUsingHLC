This code find multiple Weak Conjunctive Predicates snapshots.

Its algorithm is based on Garg's algorithm.

There is two way to find multiple snapshot:
    1. When find a consistent snapshot (all colors are GREEN), we just make all RED
       and move to find the next (via function call globalToken.reset())

    2. When find a consistent snapshot (all colors are GREEN), just mark the color
       corresponding to the smallest HVC to be RED, then move to find next (via globalToken.resetSmallest();)
    
    Method 2 is prefered since:
        + Its find much more number of consistent snapshot. For example, with the parameter setting
          of:          
            epsilon: 100005
            number_of_processes: 50
            localPredRate (beta): 0.05
            delta: 10
            run_up_to: 100000
            prob_matrix: Random
            topology: CompleteGraph
          one simulation run of method 1 found 4786 snapshots while one simulation run of method 2
          found 249459 snapshots.
    We careful when turning on the _DEBUG feature with method 2 because it will produce debugging
    file of size 10GB.
